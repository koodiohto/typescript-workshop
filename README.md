# Typescript workshop

This is a repository for sharing the materials for a Typescript workshop I have hosted.

The material consists of code files located in the [examples folder](src/examples/).

A nice repository to get insipired of are also these [type challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).

Some basic TypeScript sources:
* [Typescript language home page](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Typescript github repository](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
* [Typescript language handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
* [One good blog source for advanced types](https://aishwarya2593.medium.com/create-wonders-with-advanced-typescript-types-525acf302770)
* [Typescript development roadmap](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap)
